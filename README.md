# BizScout

AI-powered local business lead intelligence platform for website sales automation. Find businesses without websites, score and prioritize leads, manage your pipeline, schedule demos, and generate contracts.

**Stack:** React + Vite · FastAPI · PostgreSQL (Supabase) · SQLAlchemy · JWT Auth
---

## What the Website Does (Current)

- **Auth (cookie session)** — Register, login, logout, `me`, update profile (name + password). Frontend protects routes via `AuthContext`.
- **Lead scraper (Google Maps)** — Start a background scrape by **niche + city** with optional **“no website only”** filter. Live status shows progress, ETA, and streaming “found companies”. Stopping early still saves leads to the DB.
- **Lead scoring (0–100)** — Rule-based score combining 7 signals: website status, rating, review count, business age, category urgency, phone present, address present. Lead Detail shows a visual score breakdown.
- **Batches** — Each scrape run is grouped into a batch (query + location) with lead count, average score, and “no website” count.
- **Leads page** — Run scrapes, see previous batches, and view a summary of total leads and “no website” opportunities.
- **Lead Detail** — Full lead profile (name, city, phone, address, website, rating, reviews, age), pipeline stage, call outcome history, notes editor, score explanation, and per-lead contracts section.
- **Pipeline (CRM board)** — Kanban-style stages: New Lead, Contacted, Interested, Proposal Sent, Closed Won, Closed Lost.
- **Demo scheduling (Zoom)** — From Lead Detail, schedule a Zoom demo; backend creates a Zoom meeting and (if SMTP is configured) sends a professional HTML invite email with the join link.
- **Meeting reminder (current)** — Background worker sends a **single “starts soon” reminder ~10 minutes before** the meeting (only for meetings at least ~2 hours out).
- **Meetings page** — Lists upcoming demos with join links, mapped to leads.
- **Contract generator** — From Lead Detail or the Contracts area, generate a web design agreement HTML, auto-filled with lead + profile data; client can sign via a public link, and signed copies can be turned into PDFs via headless Chrome.
- **Contracts dashboard** — View all contracts, filter by status (Draft / Pending / Signed), download PDFs, and jump back to the underlying lead.
- **Stripe-powered billing & invoices** — From a signed contract, send initial and final invoices via email, generate Stripe Checkout sessions for deposits/final payments/full plan, and track payment status per lead/contract.
- **Payment links & portal** — Public payment pages let clients pay invoices securely via Stripe (full/split plans), with automatic status updates via webhooks and a payments list inside the app.
- **Analytics** — Combined dashboard for leads, batches, and contracts (total leads, “no website” share, score distribution, pipeline funnel, and contract revenue stats).

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@db.xxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
SECRET_KEY=your-long-random-secret-key-change-this-in-production
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
```

Optional for Zoom + email: `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`, optional `ZOOM_USER_ID`, and SMTP vars (see `backend/app/routers/meetings.py`).

## 9. Common Issues

**Port 8000 in use:** `lsof -i :8000` then `kill -9 <PID>`.

**Frontend can’t reach backend:** Ensure backend is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or that `VITE_API_URL` points at your Railway URL).

**Contract 401:** Log in again so the app can store the auth token; use “Generate Contract” again.

**pip brackets:** Use quotes, e.g. `pip install "pydantic[email]"`.

**bcrypt:** `pip install "bcrypt==4.0.1"` if passlib complains.

---

## 10. Saving Requirements

```bash
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## 11. Deployment

### Frontend → Vercel
1. Push repo to GitHub.
2. On Vercel, create a **New Project** from this repo and set the root directory to `frontend`.
3. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_URL` = your Railway backend URL.
4. Deploy.

### Backend → Railway
1. On Railway, create a **New Project** from the same GitHub repo.
2. Set the root directory to `backend`.
3. Add all environment variables from `backend/.env.example`.
4. Railway will detect the `Procfile` and deploy the FastAPI app.

### After deploying both:
1. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway env vars to your Vercel URL.
2. Update `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel env vars to your Railway URL.
3. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEX` in Railway to include your Vercel domain.
4. Update the Stripe webhook endpoint in the Stripe Dashboard to your Railway URL + `/payments/webhook`.
5. Redeploy both services.

---

## 12. What’s Left To Do (Next Priorities)

- **Frontend**
  - Replace remaining hardcoded API URLs (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`) with `VITE_API_URL`.
  - Add better empty/loading/error states on all pages.

- **Backend**
  - Enforce auth consistently on leads/batches/scrape/meetings routes and scope data per user.
  - Add DB migrations (Alembic) instead of relying on `create_all`.

- **Meetings**
  - Implement proper multi-step reminders (24h, 1h, 10m) with robust scheduling.

- **Sales Automation**
  - Add power dialer/call queue behavior and automated follow-ups.

- **Contracts & Billing**
  - Finish e-sign → invoice → payment automation and connect to Stripe.
